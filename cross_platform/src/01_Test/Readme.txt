1. The four projects have written on VS2012, so if you import those projects on previous VS which may not success.
2. The project Test_Program_Monitor will throw a exception when you use command 'make test' to compile and run those projects, but don't worry about it, this exception is added by me intentionally. You can use command "make" firstly to compile it and navigate to each project to run it.
