Very sorry, i am very busy recently, we use vs2005 in our team, so i have not build the project in vs2012,
but in my project, the codes donot depend any lib files and just use some hpp files.
In my opinion, there was no significant relationship between build issues and the version of vs.

1 Get the project.

2 In your IDE, update the "Additional include files" to the directory which you put boost.

3 build it.
